# 2nd Sem WebD Project

Welcome to the repository of the student portal made initially as a fun project and later submitted as a college project. This project was initially aimed to practice Flask and has implementation of some of the more popular features in Flask like the use of Flask-login, Flask-SQLAlchemy and Flask-Migrate.

The Project has three views to log into:
## 1. Admin Side
	* This features pages like Timetable addition, Teacher Assignment, Signup, and Notice addition.
	* The Signup page features sign up options to add Students, Teachers and other Admins.
	* It also features an Excel sheet integration to aid bulk registration.
			
## 2. Teacher Side
	* In the teacher's end we can assign marks to the students using the marks page.
	* We also have a grade calculator where brackets of mark ranges are given and the grades are assigned accordingly and shown in a table.
	* Again, an excel sheet intergration is provided to aid bulk mark upload.
	* A teacher can have a look at their timetables as assigned by the Admin.
	* Validation is done to show a teacher their classes only.

## 3. Student Side
	* The student end is mostly to take in information. 
	* A student can find marks to their assignments and their timetables.
	* The notice board has some good looking cards on which notices are displayed.
